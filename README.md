# Investigating Cost-effective Acoustic Detection of Drone Presence

This repository contains the code and dataset for the MSc project "Investigating Cost-effective Acoustic Detection of Drone Presence" by Yaoxiang Yu at the University of Southampton.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore cost-effective solutions for detecting the presence of drones using acoustic data. By applying machine learning techniques to acoustic signals, we aim to improve the accuracy of drone detection, making it a more feasible solution for real-world applications.

## Requirements

The code is written in Python and relies on the following libraries:

- `torch==2.5.0`  
- `numpy==1.23.5`  
- `matplotlib==3.7.2`

Ensure you have these libraries installed before running the code. You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install torch==2.5.0 numpy==1.23.5 matplotlib==3.7.2
```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains acoustic recordings for drone detection. It is included in this repository or can be accessed via the provided link (if applicable).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repositoryname.git
cd repositoryname
```

2. Install the required dependencies as mentioned above.

3. Run the code for acoustic detection:

```bash
python main.py
```

Make sure to update the file paths for the dataset if necessary.
